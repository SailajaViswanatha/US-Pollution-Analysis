# US-Pollution-Analysis
Project Summary:
Finding states and countries with maximum pollutants so that, the government can take measures to reduce it and further prevent it from happening. State, country and address is given to find a particular location with maximumpollutants. Date is given to observe, which period has high pollution. Pollutants like NO2, O3, SO2 and CO are taken into consideration.
This project helps us to understand about the insights of the data for all 4 category pollutants. The trend of all pollutants except for ozone which keeps fluctuating, is downward signifying that the air quality in the United States has become better over the years.
